# About me
Hello! I am a computer science enthusiast - specialising in Python, recently delving into Lua scripting. <br>

When completing commissions to a high standard, I make use of:
- computational thinking
  - understanding complex problems in order to form a solution
- decomposition
  - breaking tasks down into sub programs which can be made individually
- abstraction
  - simplifying details which are not relevant to the assignment
- algorithmic thinking
  - identifying logical steps from start to finish to produce a reusable algorithm

# My experience
My experience ranges from around 5 years in Python to half a year in Lua which I am building on. <br>
My knowledge of these programming languages is well demonstrated in the below projects. <br>
As well as these, I am undertaking a formal computer science qualification! 

<h2>

- A [login system](https://github.com/avchitnis/login-project)
- A [discord bot](https://github.com/avchitnis/discord-bot) 

<h2>
  Lua
