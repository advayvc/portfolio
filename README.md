# About me
Hello! <br>
I am a computer science enthusiast - specialising in Python but delving into Lua scripting too! <br>

When completing commissions to a high standard, I make use of:
- computational thinking
  - understanding complex problems in order to form a solution
- decomposition
  - breaking down a problem into sub programs which can be made individually
- abstraction
  - simplifying details to easily solve the problem
- algorithmic thinking
  - identifying logical steps from the problem to a solution to produce a reusable algorithm
