# About me
Hello! I am a computer science enthusiast - specialising in Python, recently delving into Lua scripting <br>

When completing commissions to a high standard, I make use of:
- computational thinking
  - understanding complex problems in order to form a solution
- decomposition
  - breaking tasks down into sub programs which can be made individually
- abstraction
  - simplifying details which are not relevant to the assignment
- algorithmic thinking
  - identifying logical steps from start to finish to produce a reusable algorithm
