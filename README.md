# About advayvc
Hello! I am a computer science enthusiast - specialising in Python, recently delving into Lua scripting. <br>

When completing commissions to a high standard, I make use of:
- computational thinking
  - understanding complex problems in order to form a solution
- decomposition
  - breaking tasks down into sub programs which can be made individually
- abstraction
  - simplifying details which are not relevant to the assignment
- algorithmic thinking
  - identifying logical steps from start to finish to produce a reusable algorithm

You can find my profile [here](https://www.roblox.com/users/2348124587/profile).

# Experience
My experience ranges from around 5 years in Python to one year in Lua which I am building on. <br>
My knowledge of these programming languages is well demonstrated in the below projects. <br>
As well as these, I am undertaking a formal computer science qualification! 

<h2>
  Python
</h2>

- [Login system](https://github.com/avchitnis/login-project) made using the python JSON module <br>
- [Discord bot](https://github.com/avchitnis/discord-bot) which makes good use of slash commands and Google's Gemini AI
- My [project euler solutions](https://github.com/avchitnis/project-euler/) to their first ten questions

<h2>
  Lua
</h2>

- [Mouse drag commission](https://github.com/avchitnis/mouse-commission), involves linking drag directions to animations

Specific details regarding each of these past works can be found on their individual pages. <br>
Please do feel free to have a look at them! <br>
